To enable this configuration, perform the following steps:

1. Configure your load balancer to pass through requests from the client to the Gorouter.
1. Insert the certificates into your deployment manifest for the Gorouter:
    1. Open your release manifest using your preferred text editor.
    1. Copy the contents of your certificate chain and private key associated with your certificate into the `properties.router.tls_pem` field. 
    1. Set `enable_ssl` to `true`.

        ```
        properties:
          router:
            tls_pem:
            - cert_chain: |
                -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
                SSL_CERTIFICATE_SIGNED_BY_PRIVATE_KEY
                -----END CERTIFICATE-----
              private_key: |
                -----BEGIN EXAMPLE RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
                RSA_PRIVATE_KEY
                -----END EXAMPLE RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
            enable_ssl: true
        ```
