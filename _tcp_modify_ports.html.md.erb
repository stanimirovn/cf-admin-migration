(Optional) Configure the `routing_api.router_groups` manifest property with the same range
of ports that you configured your load balancer with in the previous step:
    <pre>
    routing&#95;api.router&#95;groups:
    &minus; name: default-tcp
      reservable_ports: CONFIGURED-PORTS
      type: tcp
    </pre>
  Where `CONFIGURED-PORTS` is the range of ports that you configured your load balancer
  with in the previous step.

  For more information, see the [Routing Release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/routing-release)
  repository in GitHub. To modify the ports after you have deployed, see [Modify TCP Port
  Reservations](#modify-ports) below.
